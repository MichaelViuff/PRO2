# 01 Exercises: Observer Pattern

## 3.1 Traffic light

Download the Traffic light example that was shown in the presentation, with subject/listeners implemented. 

Run the example and verify that the 3 cars react to the traffic light changing.

Implement a new class `Taxi`: 
 - It ignores yellow lights, stops when red, and drives when green.

Implement a new class `SleepyDriver`: 
 - If the light is red, and changes to yellow, it doesnâ€™t do anything
 - When the light changes to green, it start its engine and drives.
 - If the light is green, and changes to yellow, it slows down

Implement a new class `Pedestrian`. When the cars are waiting for red light, he can cross the road:
 - When the light turns green he waits (red means red for the cars, we haven't modelled a traffic light for pedestrians)
 - When the light turns from green to yellow, he runs fast across the road.
 - When the light turns red he crosses the road.
 - When the light turns from red to yellow, he gets ready to cross.

<summary>Explanation</summary>
  <p>The time scheduler assigns time to a single thread for an amount of time. We have no control over this, and the amount of time might vary for each execution of the program. As such, sometimes we might see many numbers in a row before letter, or vice versa. And other times only a few numbers before letters are printed, or vice versa.</p>
