# 11 Assignment 2 - MVVM and Observer and Sockets

## The system:
You must design and implement a simple client/server application with multiple clients. 
Possible programs include:
- Chat system
- Tic-tac-toe

## The assignment: 
Implement the program.

## Requirements
The application must use Sockets connecting client and server with the server being multithreaded. The client must be able to 
1. send messages 
2. receive messages broadcasted to all clients and 
3. request an information from the server not to be broadcasted to other clients e.g. number of connected chatters, list of connected chatters, or similar. 

You must use MVVM with preferably at least two windows. Some ideas:
- Actual chat window
- Set user name / alias window
- List of friends window
- Login window

You must use the Observer design pattern as part of the solution.

It is required to make a UML class diagram for the final solution (in Astah). In the diagram, you must be able to identify the MVVM (just put a comment or note) the Observer pattern and the design of the socket related classes

## Hints


## Format
You are allowed to work in groups, but you must hand in individually. 

Hand in everything in a single zip-file with:

 - UML Class Diagram 
 - Source code for all classes
 - Related resources like `.FXML` files, and if used, external `.jar` files


## Deadline
See Itslearning.

## Evaluation
Your hand-in will be used during the exam, but will not be evaluated separately.

Feedback available upon request.
