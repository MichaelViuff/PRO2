# 13 Assignment 3 - RMI

## The system:
You already have an implementation from Assignment 2 - you need to change it so that it uses RMI instead of Sockets.

## The assignment: 
Change your solution to Assignment 2 to use RMI instead of Java Sockets.

## Requirements
 - The Server must be able to support multiple concurrent Clients.
 - The Client must be able to: 
   - call methods on the server
   - get return values from the server

- You must use Java [RMI](https://viaucdk-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mivi_viauc_dk/ERO8Sf8oKbRDjwm1bvBC6lYBCmmJbauJfPOOhCZ8iDkiCQ?rtime=TeDjPs1T3Eg) to connect the Client and Server
- You must create a UML Class Diagram for the final solution (preferably in Astah).

## Hints
If you have used interfaces in your solution to Assignment 2, it should be straightforward to change the network implementation to use RMI ;)

## Format
You are allowed to work in groups, but you must hand in individually. 

Hand in everything in a single zip-file with:

 - UML Class Diagram 
 - Source code for all classes
 - Related resources like `.FXML` files, and if used, external `.jar` files

## Deadline
See Itslearning.

## Evaluation
Your hand-in will be used during the exam, but will not be evaluated separately.

Feedback available upon request.
