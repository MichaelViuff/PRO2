# 18 Assignment 3 - Kingdom simulation

## The system:

In this assignment youâ€™re going to simulate a kingdom. The ultimate goal is to get `Gems` so the `King` can throw parties.

## The assignment:

Follow the instructions given [here](Assignment%204%20Instructions.md)

## Requirements

- You must follow the [instructions](Assignment%204%20Instructions.md), and implement everything accordingly.
- You must create a UML Class Diagram for the final solution (preferably in Astah).

For this assignment, there is some overlap in topics that you might have already implemented in a previous assignment.

The main topics for this assignment are:

- [Proxy and Adapter Pattern](https://viaucdk-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mivi_viauc_dk/EUGB7qts_9RLn2C35XmHCEYB4oIE6OLV06L99PMfDaZNWA?e=kD7tif)
- [Producer-Consumer Problem](https://viaucdk-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mivi_viauc_dk/EYjtVdp6yvNBjG1xTpuYdS0BEardZkqsXL3OPVWzBhnk1Q?e=lNnXuP)
- [Readers-Writers Problem](https://viaucdk-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mivi_viauc_dk/ERtQsKGzQr1EubQ9rLCy0yEBLULR7fL1GonwsHO8JqrWTg?e=qsbK4V)
- [Unit Testing](https://viaucdk-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mivi_viauc_dk/EQvTfI3cDddArBHNfkkzzfoBdKGmAkUY459xwshG9Wck5Q?e=n0bFCR)

## Hints

The system has many different parts, and following the instructions is strongly advised.

Implement one part at a time, and ensure things are working before moving onto the next part.

Focus on the main topics listed above.

## Format

You are allowed to work in groups, but you must hand in individually.

Hand in everything in a single zip-file with:

- UML Class Diagram
- Source code for all classes
- Related resources like `.FXML` files, and if used, external `.jar` files

## Deadline

See Itslearning.

## Evaluation

Your hand-in will be used during the exam, but will not be evaluated separately.

Feedback available upon request.
